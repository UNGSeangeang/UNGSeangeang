## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is UNG Seangeang. Currently, I'm a freshman at AUPP majoring in Cybersecurity.
I'm a person who have passionate with technology since I was young so I choose to study Information Technology specialized in securiy field also known as cybersecurity. I really loved my major because in my country this major is not really wide and lack of resources of this field. So I want to catch up this opportunity and develop myself as well as build up my future career. I hope one day I will be one of the human resources in my country. By the way, righ now I'm staying focus on my study because I want to persue my master degree overseas. Fun facts about me is I really enjoy playing esport (video games) but I can't play any sports.
